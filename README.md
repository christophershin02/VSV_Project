# Vesicular Stomatitis Antibody Project

Project in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic working with oncolytic viruses. 

Before I begin, I wanted to explain the purpose of the project. Some researchers at the Mayo Clinic have been working on creating oncolytic viruses (OVs), viruses that preferentially attack and kill cancer cells. One problem that these researchers were running into was that our bodies would produce antibodies that would neutralize these OVs. The researchers were able to determine which antibodies were binding to our virus (we will call them antibody 1E9 & antibody 8G5) but were not able to determine where exactly these antibodies were binding. The only clue that they had was that they were binding to the glycoprotein G on the surface of the virus (glycoprotein G is a structure on the surface of the virus which looks like a little spike). 

The researchers at the Mayo Clinic came to us to figure out where exactly on the glycoprotein G the antibody was binding to. If we can figure this out, then we can selectively mutate specific residues at the antibody binding site such that the antibody is unable to bind to the glycoprotein. In order to determine where the epitope was binding to, we had to run NAMD, a molecular dynamics software that allows us to gather information about the receptor-antibody complex.
